              <ol style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>
                      <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                      You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories
                      as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have
                      the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      <h5>Why This Project?</h5>
                      Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and
                      utilities to their users; but deep down, it’s really all just creating, reading, updating and
                      deleting data. In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of building dynamic websites with
                      persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your
                      users.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      <h5>What Will I Learn?</h5>
                      You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along
                      with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. You will then learn when to properly use the
                      various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update
                      and delete) operations.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      <h5>How Does This Help My Career?</h5>
                      Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
                      Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD
                      operations are core features of a properly secured web application.<br><br>
                </li>
              </ol>
            <h4> 2. Project Display Example </h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:square">

                      <strong>Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal

                      The Item Catalog project consists of developing an application that provides a list of items within a
                      variety of categories, as well as provide a user registration and authentication system.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      The homepage displays all current categories along with the latest added items -
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/</code><br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_1.png" alt="all items"><br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      Selecting a specific category shows you all the items available for that category -
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/items</code><br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_2.png" alt="specific items"><br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      Selecting a specific item shows you specific information of that item -
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard</code><br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_3.png" alt="specific item info"><br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                      After logging in, a user has the ability to add, update, or delete item info -
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> (logged in)<br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_4.png" alt="logged user crud ops"><br><br>
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard</code> (logged in)<br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_5.png" alt="logged user crud ops"><br><br>
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboard/edit</code> (logged in)<br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_6.png" alt="logged user crud ops"><br><br>
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboard/delete</code> (logged in)<br><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                      The application provides a JSON endpoint, at the very least -
                      <code>http://localhost:8000/catalog.json</code><br><br>
                      <img class="project img-responsive" src="../images/p_8.png" alt="JSON endpoint"><br><br>
                </li>

                      <h5>How will I complete this project?</h5>
                      This project is connected to the <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud088">Full Stack
                      Foundations</a> and <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud330">Authentication and
                      Authorization</a> courses, but depending on your background knowledge you may not need the entirety
                      of both courses to complete this project. Here's what you should do:<br><br>

                      1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox<br>
                      2. Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm<br>
                      3. Launch the Vagrant VM (<code>vagrant up</code>)<br>
                      4. Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically
                      be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).<br>
                      5. Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)<br>
                      6. Access and test your application by visiting <code>http://localhost:8000</code> locally<br><br>
