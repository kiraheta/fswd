            <h5>Project Submission</h5>
            <p>
              Cover letters accompany resumes in a job application. Even if the
              employer doesn't request a letter, they usually request additional
              information in the form of an email or introduction. This project
              will teach you how to describe your work experiences and passion
              for the job, which will be helpful throughout your job search,
              from attending mixers to interviewing.
