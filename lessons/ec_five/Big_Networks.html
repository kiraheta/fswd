            <h4> 9. Middleboxes 1: Firewalls & Filtering </h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Firewalls</strong> are devices that network operators
              can use to filter traffic that's coming into or leaving their
              network. A firewall is one example of a class of network devices
              called <strong>middleboxes</strong> — devices that inspect,
              modify, or filter network traffic. Other examples of middleboxes
              include intrusion detection systems and load balancers.
              Technically, it's only a <em>middle</em>-box if it's a separate
              device from the client or server — server-side "firewalls"
              like Linux iptables aren't middleboxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              A firewall can be a real boon to an organization's network
              security. The most common configuration for a firewall is to
              drop any incoming traffic except traffic to (host, port) pairs
              that are supposed to be receiving connections from the Internet.
              This lets the network administrator be sure that other machines
              on the network — like backend databases or administrative
              systems — aren’t going to get direct attacks from outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              But firewalls can cause trouble for application developers. If
              you're trying to test or deploy a network app and there's a
              firewall between your server and the user, that firewall can
              potentially interfere with your app or block it completely. In
              order to deploy an application on a particular server and port,
              it helps to know what kind of firewall might be between you and
              your user. One of the reasons that many non-Web applications use
              HTTP as a transport is that HTTP is often unblocked at firewalls
              even when other ports are blocked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from blocking traffic outright, middleboxes can also alter
              traffic, for instance replacing web pages with error messages.
              This is often done for social or political purposes. For instance,
              in the U.S., many schools use traffic filters of various sorts
              to prevent students from accessing web sites deemed inappropriate
              for children. But what sites get counted as "inappropriate" can
              reflect the biases or opinions of the people who wrote or
              configured the filter.
            </p>
            <p>
              And people who program these things can always make mistakes,
              too. For instance, there's a whole class of
              <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2667634/The-Clbuttic-Mistake-When-obscenity-filters-go-wrong.html">
                bugs</a> that arise from filters that try to block rude words,
                but end up blocking or replacing innocuous words that contain a
                rude word as a substring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather famously, some countries have deployed large-scale
              firewalls or filters to censor their citizens' access to the
              global Internet. Major well-known sites such as YouTube and
              Twitter are sometimes blocked entirely in some countries. That
              can happen to your site, too — just something to keep in mind.

            <h4> 11. Middleboxes 2: Proxies & NAT </h4>
            <h5><strong> Middleboxes 2: Proxies & NAT</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Earlier in this course, you learned about the IPv4 address
              shortage; and the deployment of <strong>Network Address
              Translation</strong>, or NAT, as a workaround for it. With NAT,
              several devices can access Internet resources through a single
              public IP address, with the NAT device using port numbers to
              match up connections on the inside and outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              For end-users, NAT devices overlap with firewalls. Typical home
              routers can act as both a NAT and a simple firewall, often having
              the ability to block or filter at a very basic level. At a larger
              scale, ISPs and other organizations have deployed NAT devices for
              their whole customer networks, called
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">
              carrier-grade NAT</a>. This is very common for mobile networks,
              and also for ISPs in the developing world, where there never were
              anywhere near enough addresses allocated for the number of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually we imagine an end-user computer as having only one person
              using it at a time. After all, there's generally only one mouse
              and keyboard. Two people typing on the same keyboard at the same
              time doesn't generally happen outside of
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qgehH3kEQ">poorly
              thought-out TV shows</a>. But in the case of NAT, your web site
              can see requests from the same IP address that actually come
              from different users on different computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way that can happen is through the use of
              <strong>web proxies</strong>. Whereas a NAT works at the IP level,
              rewriting packets, a web proxy works at the HTTP level, taking
              queries from browsers and sending them out to web servers. Many
              organizations use web proxies for caching, including some ISPs.
              From the standpoint of a web developer or site operator, traffic
              from a busy proxy looks much the same as traffic from a busy NAT:
              queries for many users, on many actual computers, are funneled
              through a single public IP address.

                I learned a valuable lesson about the state of the Internet
                throughout the rest of the world. Many of us are fortunate to
                live in high bandwidth regions, but there are still large
                portions of the world that do not.
