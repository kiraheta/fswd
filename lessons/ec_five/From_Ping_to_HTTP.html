            <h4> 2. Setting up for this course </h4>
            <p>
              To do the exercises in this course, you will need access to a
              Linux machine you can log into with SSH. There are a couple of
              ways you can get one: you can use a hosting service that gives
              you a Linux shell environment; or you can install a Linux-based
              virtual machine on your own computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of which path you are taking, follow the instructions
              below (under "<strong>Installing networking tools</strong>") to
              set up the networking tools for this course.
            </p><br>
            <h5><strong>Your Linux machine (Local VM option)</strong></h5>
            <p>
              If you prefer to work on your own computer instead of a
              commercial service, you can run a Linux virtual machine (VM) on
              top of your regular operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will need to install two pieces of software:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                VirtualBox, which you can get from this
                <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download
                  page</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Vagrant, which you can get from this
                <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">download
                  page</a>.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              You will also need a Unix-style terminal program. On Mac or
              Linux systems, you can use the built-in Terminal. On Windows, we
              recommend Git Bash, which is installed with the Git version
              control software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, open a terminal
              and run the following commands:
            </p>
            <pre>
<!--     -->  <code>mkdir networking
<!--     -->  cd networking
<!--     -->  vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
<!--     -->  vagrant up</code></pre>
            <p>
              This will create a new directory for this course and begin
              downloading a Linux image into this directory. It may take a long
              time to download, depending on your Internet connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it is complete, you can log into the Linux instance with
              <code>vagrant ssh</code>. You are now ready to continue with the
              course.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you log out of the Linux instance or close the terminal, the
              next time you want to use it you only need to run
              <code>cd networking</code> and <code>vagrant ssh</code>.
            </p><br>
            <h5><strong>Installing networking tools</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Regardless of whether you're using the local or remote option,
              you'll need to install some networking tools to do this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              SSH into your Linux machine. Then take a moment to bring it up to
              date with any package updates:
              <code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on how recently that machine was set up, you may get
              messages asking whether it's OK to install various packages or
              change various files. It should be safe to accept any changes
              the updater proposes to make.
            </p>
            <p>
              (If you haven't seen it before, the <code>&&</code> in the above
              command means "run the first program; then if that succeeds, run
              the second program." Useful shell trick.)
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two reasons to do this update now: first, it's a good
              practice to keep your servers up to date; and second, if you
              don't update it, the new software for this course may not install
              correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll be using several network utility programs in this course.
              Some of them may already be installed, but just to make sure,
              let's install them all:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>sudo apt-get install netcat-openbsd tcpdump traceroute mtr
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once this installation completes, your machine is ready to do the
              exercises in this course.
            </p>

            <h4> 13. Experiment with nc and HTTP </h4>
            <p>
              To get a better understanding of what netcat can do here, take
              another look at the <strong>nc</strong> manual page. Specifically,
              there's a section in there titled
              "<strong>Talking to Servers</strong>". Take a look at that
              section. Then, using what you learn there and what you've seen
              already in this lesson, try some experiments of your own with
              <strong>nc</strong> and web servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some ideas:
            </p><br>
            <h5><strong>Sending HTTP headers</strong></h5>
            <p>
              When you send an HTTP request using <strong>nc</strong>, the
              headers occur on lines after the HTTP verb itself. The
              <strong>Host</strong>: header you've seen in the previous
              exercises is required by the HTTP 1.1 protocol. What happens if
              you make requests that don't provide this header?
            </p>
            <p>
              Are there other headers that it might be interesting to try
              sending? You can find a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">
                list of HTTP headers at Wikipedia</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              What happens if you send a header you just made up?
            </p>
            <p>
              What happens if you send an HTTP verb you just made up, instead
              of GET or HEAD or POST or the other real ones?
            </p><br>
            <h5><strong>Interpreting responses</strong></h5>
            <p>
              If you send a well-formed request for host
              may get back a <strong>302 Found</strong> response with a
              <strong>Location</strong>: header. What does this header mean?
              What would a browser do in response to receiving that header?
            </p><br>
            <h5><strong>Fetching content</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Most of the requests you have sent using <strong>nc</strong> are
              HEAD requests. HEAD is an HTTP verb that asks the server to
              send just the headers for a resource, rather than sending the
              full data. You can do GET requests as well, though:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n" | nc www.example.com 80</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              How would you separate the headers from the data in the response
              you get here?
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like to save the results of an <strong>nc</strong>
              command to a file, you can do this with the > shell redirection
              operator. For instance, this will save the results to the file
              <strong>example.txt</strong>:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n" | nc www.example.com 80 > example.txt</code>
            </p>

              Here's that command for you to copy:

            <p>
              <code>printf 'HTTP/1.1 302 Moved\r\nLocation:

            </p>
            <p>
              You will need to use the IP address of your Linux server in the
              URL that you put into your browser.
