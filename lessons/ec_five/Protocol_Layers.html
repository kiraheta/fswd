            <h4> 10. TCP Flags </h4>
            <p>
              Each TCP packet record that you look at in <strong>tcpdump
              </strong> has a section called <strong>Flags</strong> that
              appears right after the address and port information. It has one
              or more letters or dots inside square brackets:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
<!--     -->  19:51:58.304117 IP 10.20.27.153.59328 > 93.184.216.34.80: Flags
              <br>  [S], seq 2574797435, win 26883, options [mss 8961,sackOK,
              <br>  TS val 689168793 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Take a look at your tcpdump data again. You'll see different
              packets having flags such as <code>[S]</code>, <code>[S.]</code>,
              <code>[.]</code>, <code>[P.]</code>, and <code>[F.]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>Flags</code> field in tcpdump tells you which flags, or control bits, are set on each TCP packet.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>What is a flag?</strong></h5>
            <p>
              In low-level computer languages, a <strong>flag</strong> is a
              Boolean value — a true or false value — that is stored in memory
              as a single bit. If a flag bit is 1, we say the flag is set. If
              the flag bit is 0, the flag is <em>cleared</em> (or <em>unset</em>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, flags come in groups, each of which can be set or
              cleared.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>The six basic TCP flags</strong></h5>
            <p>
              The original TCP packet format has six flags. Two more optional
              flags have since been standardized, but they are much less
              important to the basic functioning of TCP. For each packet,
              <strong>tcpdump</strong> will show you which flags are set on
              that packet.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                SYN (synchronize) <code>[S]</code> — This packet is opening a
                new TCP session and contains a new initial sequence number.
              </li>
              <li>
                FIN (finish) <code>[F]</code> — This packet is used to close a
                TCP session normally. The sender is saying that they are
                finished sending, but they can still receive data from the
                other endpoint.
              </li>
              <li>
                PSH (push) <code>[P]</code> — This packet is the end of a
                chunk of application data, such as an HTTP request.
              </li>
              <li>
                RST (reset) <code>[R]</code> — This packet is a TCP error
                message; the sender has a problem and wants to reset (abandon)
                the session.
              </li>
              <li>
                ACK (acknowledge) <code>[.]</code> — This packet acknowledges
                that its sender has received data from the other endpoint.
                <em>Almost every packet except the first SYN will have the ACK
                flag set</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                URG (urgent) <code>[U]</code> — This packet contains data that
                needs to be delivered to the application out-of-order.
                <em>Not used in HTTP or most other current applications</em>.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h5><strong>Three-way handshake</strong></h5>
            <p>
              The first packet sent to initiate a TCP session always has the
              SYN flag set. This <em>initial SYN packet</em> is what a client
              sends to a server to start opening a TCP connection. This is the
              first packet you see in the sample tcpdump data, with
              <code>Flags [S]</code>. This packet also contains a new,
              randomized sequence number (<code>seq</code> in tcpdump output).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the server accepts the connection, it sends a packet back that
              has the SYN and ACK flags, and acknowledges the initial SYN.
              This is the second packet in the sample data, with
              <code>Flags [S.]</code>. This contains a different initial
              sequence number.
            </p>
            <p>
              (If the server doesn't want to accept the connection, it may not
              send anything at all. Or it may send a packet with the RST flag.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the client acknowledges receiving the SYN|ACK packet by
              sending an ACK packet of its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              This exchange of three packets is usually called the TCP
              three-way handshake. In addition to sequence numbers, the two
              endpoints also exchange other information used to set up the
              connection.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Four-way teardown</strong></h5>
            <p>
              When either endpoint is done sending data into the connection, it
              can send a FIN packet to indicate that it is finished. The other
              endpoint will send an ACK to indicate that it has received the
              FIN.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the example HTTP data, the client sends its FIN first, as soon
              as it is done sending the HTTP request. This is the first
              packet containing <code>Flags [F.]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually the other endpoint will be done sending as well, and
              will send a FIN of its own. Then the first endpoint will send
              an ACK.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>In between</strong></h5>
            <p>
              In a long-running connection, there will be many packets
              exchanged back and forth. Some of them will contain application
              data; others may be only acknowledgments with no data (
              <code>length 0</code>). However, all TCP packets in a connection
              except the initial SYN will contain an acknowledgment of all the
              data that the sender has received so far. Therefore, they will
              all have the ACK flag set. (This is why tcpdump depicts the ACK
              flag with just a dot: it's really common.)
            </p>
            <h5><strong>ICMP and UDP don't have TCP flags</strong></h5>
            <p>
              If you look at tcpdump data for pings or basic DNS lookups, you
              will not see flags. This is because ping uses ICMP, and basic
              DNS lookups use UDP. These protocols do not have TCP flags or
              sequence numbers.
            </p>
