            <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGjm8Q2tdoI"> 1. Welcome to the Full Stack Nanodegree Program </a></h4>
            <p>
               Welcome!<br><br>
               Here's a list of what you will be building in this program.
            </p>
            <h4> Projects in the Full Stack Nanodegree Program </h4>
            <ol><li><h5> Movie Trailer Website </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
               In this project, you will write server-side Python code to store
               a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a
               movie trailer URL. You'll then use your code to generate a
               static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and
               watch the trailers.
            </p>
            <ol><li><h5> Build a Portfolio Site </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
              In this project, you will be provided with a design mockup as a
              PDF file and will replicate that design in HTML and CSS.<br><br>

              You will develop a responsive website that will display images,
              descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will
              complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.
            </p>
            <ol><li><h5> Logs Analysis </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
              You will use an SQL database to analyze logs from a web service
              and present it as a report. The report includes summary
              information such as the most popular pages on the site, as well
              as an analysis of the site's availability based on error codes.
            </p>
            <ol><li><h5> Item Catalog </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
              You will develop an application that provides a list of items
              within a variety of categories, as well as a user registration
              and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability
              to post, edit and delete their own items.
            </p>
            <ol><li><h5> Neighborhood Map </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
              You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your
              neighborhood (or a neighborhood you would like to visit). You will
              then add functionality to this application, including map markers
              to identify popular locations or places you'd like to visit, a
              search function to easily discover these locations, and a list
              view to support simple browsing of all locations.<br><br>

              You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide
              additional information about each of these locations (such as
              StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, or Yelp reviews).
            </p>
            <ol><li><h5> Linux Server Configuration </h5></li></ol>
            <p>
              In this project, you'll secure and configure a Linux server
              running in the cloud, and deploy one of your previous projects to
              it. You'll apply system administration skills to set up the server
              so that your application can securely talk to a locally hosted
              database, and run your project code behind an Apache web
              server.<br><br>
