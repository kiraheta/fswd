            <h4> 2. Your Udacity Profile </h4>
            <p>
              In addition to the Career Lessons and Projects you'll find in your
              Nanodegree program, you have a Udacity Professional Profile linked
              in the left sidebar.<br><br>

              Your Udacity Professional Profile features important, professional
              information about yourself. When you make your profile public, it
              becomes accessible to our Hiring Partners:<br>
              Your profile will also connect you with recruiters and hiring
              managers who come to Udacity to hire skilled Nanodegree
              graduates.<br><br>

              As you complete projects in your Nanodegree program, they will be
              automatically added to your Udacity Professional Profile to ensure
              you're able to show employers the skills you've gained through
              the program. In order to differentiate yourself from other
              candidates, make sure to go in and customize those project cards.
              In addition to these projects, be sure to:<br>

              <ol><li>Keep your profile updated with your basic info and job
              preferences, such as location</li>
              <li>Ensure you upload your latest resume</li>
              <li>Return regularly to your Profile to update your projects and
                ensure you're showcasing your best work</li></ol>
              If you are looking for a job, make sure to keep your Udacity
              Professional Profile updated and visible to recruiters!
