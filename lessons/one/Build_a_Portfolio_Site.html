                    <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                    For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website.
                    You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you
                    must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will
                    develop a responsive website that will display images,
                    descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects
                    you will complete through the course of your Nanodegree
                    program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate
                    the mockup, you may also use your own custom images to
                    personalize this project.<br><br>

                    Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you
                    are encouraged to continue tweaking and making
                    customizations to the design to personalize it and make it
                    your own! This is your living portfolio site, so make sure
                    you're happy with it.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                    <h5>Why This Project?</h5>
                    The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which
                    school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see
                    what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to
                    show off your skills.<br><br>

                    In this project you’ll build a great looking portfolio
                    where you can show off images, descriptions and links to
                    all of your projects. You'll do so by writing code that
                    conforms to the
                    <a href="http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/">
                      Udacity Style Guide.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                    <h5>What Will I Learn?</h5>
                    You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a
                    web page and start to think of every web page as a number
                    of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position
                    those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.<br><br>

                    You'll accomplish this while conforming to a
                    <a href="http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/">
                      style guide</a>
                    which is an important constraint once you step into any
                    existing development position.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                    <h5>Why is this important to my career?</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at your
                        resume much less interview you.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        At their very foundation, web applications are just
                        content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that
                        language is structured.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable
                        experience; CSS empowers you to create beautiful content
                        regardless of your user’s device.
