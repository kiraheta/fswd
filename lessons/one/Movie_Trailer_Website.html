          <h4><a href=""> 1. Project Overview </a></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
                  <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                  You will write server-side code to store a list of your
                  favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie
                  trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static
                  web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch
                  the trailers.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <h5>Why This Project?</h5>
                  At their core, Full Stack Web Developers are programmers -
                  you just happen to specialize in writing applications for the
                  web! In this project, youâ€™ll write your first application
                  that is accessible via a web browser.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <h5>What Will I Learn?</h5>
                  You will learn how to write an application using
                  object-oriented Python. You will then learn how to make this
                  application serve HTML via a web server.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <h5>How does this Help my Career?</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You will establish a foundation in core programming
                      concepts using Python</li>
                    <li>You will understand the role a simple web server has in
                      receiving a request, executing a block of code and
                      generating a response</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>

          <h4> 2. Project Display Example </h4>
            <p>
              The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to
              store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art
              imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a
              web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the
              trailers.
            </p><br>
          <h4> 3. Project Details</h4>
          <h5>How will I complete this project?</h5>
          <p>
            This project is connected to the Programming Foundations with
            Python course, but depending on your background knowledge you may
            not need the entirety of the course to complete this project.
            Here's what you should do:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
                1. Install <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your
                favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster
                URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent
                your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a
                list.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies,
                we have provided a starter code repository that contains a
                Python module called <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code>. To get
                started, <code>fork</code>
                this <a href="https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py">repository
                </a> to create your own copy in GitHub. Then <code>clone</code>
                your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project
                locally on your computer. The <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code>
                module has a
                function called <code>open_movies_page</code> that takes in one argument,
                which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will
                display all of your favorite movies.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to
                load it in a browser.
            </li><br>
          </ol>
          <h5>Code Quality</h5>
          <p>
            Is your code organized and professional? If you need an idea of
            how to format and style your code to look organized and
            professional, check out the Google
            <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Python
              Style Guide</a> and the
            <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>
              site.<br><br>

            Because Python is sensitive to white space and indents, make sure
            that you follow the formatting rules found here.<br><br>
          </p>

                  trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page
