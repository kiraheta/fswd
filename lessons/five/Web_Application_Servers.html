            <h4> 1. Introduction </h4>
            <p>
              Now that you have a shiny new server that is safe and secure,
              it’s time to turn it into a web application server! By the end of
              this lesson you will accomplish the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Use the Apache HTTP Server to respond to HTTP requests and
                serve a static webpage
              </li>
              <li>
                Configure Apache to hand-off specific requests to Python
                providing the ability to develop dynamic websites
              </li>
              <li>
                Setup PostgreSQL and write a simple Python application that
                generates a data-driven website
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              At the end of this lesson, the response cycle will resemble this:
            </p>

            <h4> 2. Vagrant Prerequisites </h4>
            <p>
              If you’re using the Vagrant virtual machine from earlier in this
              course you will need to make a slight modification to the
              configuration of this machine to make your web server accessible.
              This step is not related to configuring a web server in general,
              it’s just a condition of our current environment. You would not
              need to complete this step if you were configuring a machine from
              a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the <code>Vagrantfile</code> in your project
              directory and look for the following section near lines 20-23:
            </p>
            <p style="background-color: #ededed; display: inline-block;">
              # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port<br>
              # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,<br>
              # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.<br>
              # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncomment the last line:
            </p>
            <p style="background-color: #ededed; display: inline-block;">
              config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
            </p>
            <p>
              Save the file and start your Vagrant virtual machine using the
              <code>vagrant up</code> command. If your virtual machine is
              currently running, you can reload it using the <code>vagrant
              reload</code> command.<br><br>

              This configuration change will setup port forwarding from port
              8080 on the host machine (your computer) to the guest machine
              (your Vagrant virtual machine) when your virtual machine is
              running. This will allow you to access your web server using the
              URL http://localhost:8080.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h5>Compatibility note</h5>
            </p>
            <p>
              On some Windows systems, you will need to add one more argument
              to the line to ensure that the VM network connects to the correct
              interface on your host computer:
            </p>
            <p style="background-color: #ededed; display: inline-block;">
              config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080,
              host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
            </p>
              <h4> 3. Installing Apache </h4>
            <p>
              You’ll setup your web application server one piece at a time,
              testing each as you progress. The first step is to get your
              server responding to HTTP requests. To do this, you’ll use Apache
              HTTP Server - the most commonly installed web server on the
              Internet with roughly 47% market share.<br><br>

              Install Apache using your package manager with the following
              command: <code>sudo apt-get install apache2</code> Confirm Apache
              is working by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser. You
              should see the following page:
            </p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="../../images/apache.png"
                 alt="Apache2 Ubuntu default page"><br>
            <p>
              Apache, by default, serves its files from the <code>
              /var/www/html</code> directory. If you explore this directory you
              will find a file called <code>index.html</code> and if you review
              that file you will see it contains the HTML of the page you see
              when you visit http://localhost:8080.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h5> Exercise </h5>
            </p>
            <p>
              Update the <code>index.html</code> to simply display
              “Hello, World!” and refresh your browser to see your new page.
            </p>
            <h4> 4. Installing mod_sgwi </h4>
            <p>
              When Apache receives a request it has a number of ways it can
              respond. What you’ve seen thus far is the simplest method of
              operation, Apache just returns a file requested or the <code>
              index.html</code> file if no file is defined within the URL.
              <br><br>

              But, Apache can do so much more! You’ll now configure Apache to
              hand-off certain requests to an application handler - mod_wsgi.
              The first step in this process is to install mod_wsgi:
              <code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi</code>.<br><br>

              You then need to configure Apache to handle requests using the
              WSGI module. You’ll do this by editing the
              <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf</code> file.
              This file tells Apache how to respond to requests, where to find
              the files for a particular site and much more. You can read up on
              everything this file can do within the Apache documentation.<br><br>

              For now, add the following line at the end of
              the <code><VirtualHost *:80></code> block, right before the closing
              <code></VirtualHost></code>
              line: <code>WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/myapp.wsgi</code>
              <br><br>

              Finally, restart Apache with the <code>sudo apache2ctl
              restart</code> command.
            </p>
            <h4> 5. Your First WSGI Application </h4>
            <p>
              <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">WSGI</a> is a
              specification that describes how a web server communicates with
              web applications. Most if not all Python web
              frameworks are WSGI compliant, including Flask and Django; but to
              quickly test if you have your Apache configuration correct you’ll
              write a very basic WSGI application.<br><br>

              You just defined the name of the file you need to write within
              your Apache configuration by using the <code>WSGIScriptAlias
              </code> directive. Despite having the extension <code>.wsgi
              </code>, these are just Python applications. Create the
              <code>/var/www/html/myapp.wsgi</code> file using the
              command <code>sudo nano /var/www/html/myapp.wsgi</code>. Within this file,
              write the following application:<br><br>
            </p>
            <p style="background-color: #ededed; display: inline-block;">
              def application(environ, start_response):<br>
              status = '200 OK'<br>
              output = 'Hello World!'<br><br>

              response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'), ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]<br>
              start_response(status, response_headers)<br><br>

              return [output]<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              This application will simply print return <code>Hello World!
              </code> along with the required HTTP response headers. After
              saving this file you can reload
              <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to see your application run in
              all its glory!
            </p>
            <h4> 6. Installing PostgreSQL </h4>
              <p>
                Most web applications require persistent data storage,
                typically using a database server. You will now install
                PostgreSQL to server your data using the command
                <code>sudo apt-get install postgresql</code>.

                Since you are installing your web server and database server on
                the same machine, you do not need to modify your firewall
                settings. Your web server will communicate with the database
                via an internal mechanism that does not cross the boundaries of
                the firewall. If you were installing your database on a
                separate machine, you would need to modify the firewall settings
                on both the web server and the database server to permit these
                requests.
