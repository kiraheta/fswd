            <h4> 1. Project Overview </h4>
              <p>
                You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and
                prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your
                server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a
                database server, and deploy one of your existing web
                applications onto it.
              </p>
              <h5>Why this Project?</h5>
              <p>
                A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are
                doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between
                multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web
                Developer. In this project, you’ll be responsible for turning
                a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and
                efficient web application host your applications need.
              </p>
              <h5>What will I Learn?</h5>
              <p>
                You will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial
                configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn
                how to install and configure a web and database server and
                actually host a web application.
              </p>
              <h5>How does this Help my Career?</h5>
              <p>
                1. Deploying your web applications to a publicly accessible server is the first step in getting users<br>
                2. Properly securing your application ensures your application remains stable and that your user’s data is safe
              </p>
            <h4> 2. Project Details </h4>
            <p>
              This project is linked to the
              <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud299">Configuring
              Linux Web Servers</a> course, which teaches you to secure and set
              up a Linux server. By the end of this project, you will have one
              of your web applications running live on a secure web server.
              <br><br>

              To complete this project, you'll need a Linux server instance.
              We recommend using <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/">
              Amazon Lightsail</a> for this. If you don't
              already have an Amazon Web Services account, you'll need to set
              one up. Once you've done that, here are the steps to complete
              this project.
            </p><br>
            <h5>Get your server.</h5>
            <p>
              1. Start a new Ubuntu Linux server instance on Amazon Lightsail.
              There are full details on setting up your Lightsail instance on
              the next page.<br>
              2. Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server.
            </p><br>
            <h5>Secure your server.</h5>
            <p>
              3. Update all currently installed packages.<br>
              4. Change the SSH port from <strong>22</strong> to <strong>
              2200</strong>. Make sure to configure
              the Lightsail firewall to allow it.<br>
              5. Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow
              incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and
              NTP (port 123).
            </p><br>
            <p><span style="color: red;">Warning</span>: When changing the SSH
              port, make sure that the firewall is open for port 2200 first,
              so that you don't lock yourself out of the server.
              <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/ab002e9a-b26c-43a4-8460-dc4c4b11c379/modules/357367901175461/lessons/4331066009/concepts/48010894990923">
              Review this video </a> for details! When you change the
              SSH port, the Lightsail instance will no longer be accessible
              through the web app 'Connect using SSH' button. The button
              assumes the default port is being used. There are instructions on
              the same page for connecting from your terminal to the instance.
              Connect using those instructions and then follow the rest of the
              steps.
            </p><br>
            <h5>Give <code>grader</code> access.</h5>
            <p>
              In order for your project to be reviewed, the grader needs to be
              able to log in to your server.<br><br>

              6. Create a new user account named grader.<br>
              7. Give grader the permission to sudo.<br>
              8. Create an SSH key pair for grader using the ssh-keygen tool.<br>
            </p>
            <h5>Prepare to deploy your project.</h5>
            <p>
              9. Configure the local timezone to UTC.<br>
              10. Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi
              application.<br>
              11. Install and configure PostgreSQL:<br>
              <ol>
                <li>Do not allow remote connections</li>
                <li>Create a new database user named catalog that has limited
                  permissions to your catalog application database.</li>
              </ol>

              12. Install git.
            </p>
            <h5>Deploy the Item Catalog project.</h5>
            <p>
              13. Clone and setup your <strong>Item Catalog</strong> project from
              the Github repository you created earlier in this Nanodegree
              program.<br>
              14. Set it up in your server so that it functions correctly when
              visiting your server’s IP address in a browser. Make sure that
              your <code>.git</code> directory is not publicly accessible via a
              browser!
            </p>
            <h4> 3. Get started on Lightsail </h4>
            <p>
              We're recommending <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/">
              Amazon Lightsail</a> for this project. If you
              prefer, you can use any other service that gives you a publicly
              accessible Ubuntu Linux server. But Lightsail works pretty well
              and it's what we've tested.
            </p>
            <h4> 4. Webcasts for the Linux Server Configuration Project </h4>
            <p>
              Need some additional help getting started with the Linux Server
              Configuration Project, or simply curious and want to learn a
              little bit more? Watch the following Webcasts!<br><br>

              These webcasts are recordings of live Q&A sessions and demos. As
              always, you should read the appropriate rubric for your project
              thoroughly before you begin work on any project and double check
              the rubric before submitting. The videos were made by Udacity's
              coaches. Think of them as extra supplemental materials.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              The webcasts for the Linux Server Configuration Project include:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwK8IWc-a8">SSH: How to access a remote server and edit files</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ0cUWWixqU">Intro to TMux</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UNAy4GzQ5E">Deploying a Flask App with Heroku</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Happy Learning!</p>
            <h4> 5. Project Submission </h4>
            <p>
              You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on
              a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications,
              to include installing updates, securing it from a number of
              attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database
              servers.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
