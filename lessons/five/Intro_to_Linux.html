            <ol>
              <li>
                In this course we’ll be working with Ubuntu. It’s an excellent
                distribution for a variety of use cases, including web servers.
                We’ll run our Ubuntu server within a virtual machine, which is
                a special piece of software running on your computer that acts
                as if it is a stand-alone computer.<br><br>

                To accomplish this requires a bit of setup but will give
                everyone the same Linux environment to work within, even if
                you’re on Windows or OSX currently.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Required Software</h4>
                If you've already downloaded and installed these items, perhaps
                while completing a different course, you do not need to
                download and install these items again.<br><br>

                1. Download and install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">
                VirtualBox</a>. This is free software that will run the
                virtual machine.<br>
                2. Download and install <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">
                Vagrant</a>. This is an command line utility that makes it easy
                to manage and access your virtual machines.<br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Course Environment</h4>
                Follow these steps to setup an environment where you can work
                on this course:<br><br>

                1. Create a new folder on your computer where you’ll store your
                work for this course, then open that folder within your
                terminal.<br>
                2. Type <code>vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64</code> to tell
                Vagrant what kind of Linux virtual machine you would like to
                run.<br>
                3. Type <code>vagrant up</code> to download and start running
                the virtual machine<br>

                This last step could take some time since the virtual machine
                files can be quite large. For now, leave this window up and
                continue the course. You’ll come back to this window later and
                actually interact with your Linux machine a bit later.

            <h4> 7. Vagrant Commands </h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We’re now ready to get started working within our Linux virtual
                machine. If your download hasn’t completed from the initial
                setup, go ahead and take a break and come back when that has
                completed. You won’t be able to make further progress until
                the virtual machine is up and running as much of the course
                will take place within this environment.<br><br>

                Before we access our machine, let’s quickly review a few
                commands that vagrant provides to make managing your virtual
                machines much simpler. Remember, your vagrant machine lives
                within this specific folder on your computer so make sure
                you’re within that same folder your created earlier; otherwise
                these commands won’t work as expected.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant status</code><br>
                This command will show you the current status of the virtual
                machine. It should currently read “default running (virtualbox)”
                along with some other information.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant suspend</code><br>
                This command suspends your virtual machine. All of your work
                is saved and the machine is put into a “sleep mode” of sorts.
                The machines state is saved and it’s very quick to stop and
                start your work. You should use this command if you plan to
                just take a short break from your work but don’t want to leave
                the virtual machine running.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant up</code><br>
                This gets your virtual machine up and running again. Notice we
                didn’t have to redownload the virtual machine image, since it’s
                already been downloaded.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant ssh</code><br>
                This command will actually connect to and log you into your
                virtual machine. Once done you will see a few lines of text
                showing various performance statistics of the virtual machine
                along with a new command line prompt that reads
                vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                Here are a few other important commands that we’ll discuss but
                you do not need to practice at this time:<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant halt</code><br>
                This command halts your virtual machine. All of your work is
                saved and the machine is turned off - think of this as
                “turning the power off”. It’s much slower to stop and start
                your virtual machine using this command, but it does free up
                all of your RAM once the machine has been stopped. You should
                use this command if you plan to take an extended break from
                your work, like when you are done for the day. The command
                vagrant up will turn your machine back on and you can continue
                your work.
              </li><br>
              <li>
                <code>vagrant destroy</code><br>
                This command destroys your virtual machine. Your work is not
                saved, the machine is turned off and forgotten about for the
                most part. Think of this as formatting the hard drive of a
                computer. You can always use vagrant up to relaunch the machine
                but you’ll be left with the baseline Linux installation from
                the beginning of this course. You should not have to use this
                command at any time during this course unless, at some point in
                time, you perform a task on the virtual machine that makes it
                completely inoperable.
