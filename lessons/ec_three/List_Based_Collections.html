          <h4> 4. Quiz: Python Lists</h4>
          <p>
            Python has an interesting data stucture called a "list" that is
            much more than a mere list. In fact, a Python list actually
            encompasses the functionality of almost every list-based data
            structure in this lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the scenes a Python list is built as an array. Even though
            you can do many operations on a Python list with just one line of
            code, there's a lot of code built in to the Python language running
            to make that operation possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, inserting into a list is easy (happens in constant
            time). However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need
            to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or
            even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus,
            inserting into a Python list is actually O(n), while operations
            that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1). You can
            see the runtime of other list operations
            <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is a "higher level" programming language, so you can
            accomplish a task with little code. However, there's a lot of code
            built into the infrastructure in this way that causes your code to
            actually run much more slowly than you'd think. Keep this in the
            back of your mind when using Python. You likely won't need to know
            the details of how Python works behind the scenes in a programming
            interview, but you'll seem very impressive if you do!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you aren't already comfortable with Python lists, you can look
            through this lesson about basic Python list manipulation.

          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZONGA5wmREI"> 6. Linked Lists In Depth </a></h4>
          <h4><a href=""> 7. Quiz: Linked List Practice </a></h4>
          <p>
            This code is very similarâ€”we're just establishing that a
            <code>LinkedList</code> is something that has a
            <code>head Element</code>, which is the first element in the list.
            If we establish a new <code>LinkedList</code> without a
            <code>head</code>, it will default to <code>None</code>.
          </p>
          <p>Great! Let's add a method to our <code>LinkedList</code> to make
            it a little more useful. This method will add a new
            <code>Element</code> to the end of our <code>LinkedList</code>.
          </p>
          <pre style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;
          ">
            <code class="language-python">
<!--       --> def append(self, new_element):
<!--       -->     current = self.head
<!--       -->     if self.head:
<!--       -->         while current.next:
<!--       -->             current = current.next
<!--       -->         current.next = new_element
<!--       -->     else:
<!--       -->         self.head = new_element
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            Again, this part is really important, so don't rush through it.
            Take the code line-by-line and make sure everything makes sense.
            If the <code>LinkedList</code> already has a <code>head</code>,
            iterate through the <code>next</code> reference in every
            <code>Element</code> until you reach the end of the list. Set
            <code>next</code> for the end of the list to be the
            <code>new_element</code>. Alternatively, if there is no
            <code>head</code> already, you should just assign
            <code>new_element</code> to it and do nothing else.
          </p>

          <h4> 10. Quiz: Stack Practice </h4>
          <p>
            Remember that wonderful Python list we talked about eariler? It
            turns out that stack functionality is already built into it!
          </p>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-stacks">
            Python documentation</a> shows how you can use built-in funtions to
            turn your Python list into a stack. <code>pop()</code> is a given
            function, and <code>append()</code> is equivalent to a push
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this functionality makes stack manipulation in Python
            all too easy. Let's make our own <code>Stack</code> class to see
            how a stack really works under the hood.
          </p>
          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAbzlilAHZw"> 11. Queues </a></h4>
          <h4> 12. Quiz: Queue Practice </h4>
          <p>
            Let's look at implementing queues in Python. Queue's are mentioned
            in
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-queues">
            Python's documentation</a>. Examine the code below:
          </p>
          <pre style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;
          ">
            <code class="language-python">
              from collections import deque
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              From a library called <code>collections</code>, you can import a
              package called <code>deque</code>. As was mentioned in the video,
              a deque is a double-ended queue. You can enqueue on either end,
              but in the example you only enqueue one way and treat it as a
              normal queue.
