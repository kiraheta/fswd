          <h4> 3. STAR Method </h4>
          <p>
            Here is one example of a behavioral question and using the STAR
            method to respond to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do you handle conflict? How do you solve problems?
          </p>
          <blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
            Describe an example when you had a disagreement with your
            coworker/manager. Why did it happen? How did you handle it?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Disagreements by themselves are not a problem. In fact, they are
            bound to happen, so it’s all about how you react. Again use the
            STAR method here, focusing on how you resolved the situation
            professionally and productively, choose a situation in which the
            disagreement was resolved well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Situation:</strong> "One day before we were going to launch
            a new feature,
            a new vulnerability was announced in vendor software we use.
            Patching the problem adequately meant sliding the already delayed
            schedule. Another team member and I disagreed about which took
            precedence, the security patch or the feature release. The
            marketing department had a lot riding on this deadline.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> "We needed to decide which goal to pursue
            and work together as a team."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action:</strong> "We decided to look into the details of
            each problem together. Clearly the deadline was important, but our
            users’ data might be at risk if we didn’t patch our system. I was
            tasked to research the security threat more closely, and I realized
            it did not apply to our users because none of them used that browser
            which had the vulnerability. So we could just post a message on our
            website about the browser."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result:</strong> "We were able to release our product
            feature on time even while taking the time to work together to
            consider an important issue not everyone agreed with at the time."
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep the STAR method in mind whenever you are asked to problem-solve
            or describe an experience during interviews.
