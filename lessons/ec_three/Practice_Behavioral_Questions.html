            <p>
              It is time to practice. In this lesson, you will have the
              opportunity to answer and reflect on interview questions generated
              by our own hiring managers, engineers, and students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, you will review several job candidate answers from the
              interviewer’s perspective. This will allow you to experience both
              sides of the interview and analyze responses.
            </p>

          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg4HUMgKLxI"> 3. Analyzing Behavioral Answers </a></h4>
            <p>
              You are about to play the role of the interviewer and review
              other job candidates answers to some of the typical behavioral
              questions you saw earlier. As you watch, get into the mindset of
              the interviewer and ask yourself the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do they use the STAR method?</li>
              <li>What is their tone of voice?</li>
              <li>Do they answer the question concisely or do they get off track?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <em>
                *NOTE: The answers you are about to see were recorded alone
                with a webcam so much of the conversational nature of these
                questions is lost. In a real interview, more back-and-forth
                discussion is likely to exist.
              </em>

          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29mkriaGT0E"> 4. Time When You Showed Initiative? </a></h4>
            <p>Our Analysis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The candidate gave a great example of initiative, and it was
                related to documentation (a topic often overlooked by
                programmers).
              </li>
              <li>The candidate’s tone of voice and pacing could be improved —
                it felt a little too mechanical/rehearsed.
              </li>
              <li>The candidate researched his idea before implementing it.
              </li>
              <li>The candidate was specific about the impact of his actions,
                but would like to have personalized anecdotes (ex. An employee
                was working on a project, and it really helped him…).
              </li>
            </ul>
          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa9SFwiRbho"> 5. What Motivates You At The Workplace? </a></h4>
          <p>Our Analysis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The candidate showed high energy, and her passion is evident.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate could have been more specific about what she is
              passionate about and hot it relates back to the job.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate could use fewer hand gestures to strengthen the
              impact of each gesture.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate gave good examples of intrinsic and extrinsic
              motivators — but could have provided more personalized examples.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IKqdW30GvQ"> 6. A Problem And How You Dealt With It? </a></h4>
          <p>Our Analysis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The candidate’s response was a little long, but still complete
              and answered the question fully.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate could minimize the delays in speech (i.e. “uhs”
              and “ums”)
            </li>
            <li>The candidate spoke more about the team’s effort than his
              individual contributions. (Note that depending on the content,
              there is nothing wrong with focusing more on the team’s effort.
              For example, if your contributions are more managerial in nature,
              then make sure to focus on those managerial actions you took to
              solve the problem.)
            </li>
            <li>The candidate explained the problem and solution in great
              detail. He could have emphasized some larger themes in order to
              make it easier for the interviewer to synthesize the information
              and avoid confusion.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate gave numerical growth numbers — this is great.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcTfHemUvbM"> 7. What Do You Know About The Company? </a></h4>
          <p>Our Analysis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The candidate took initiative in researching the company.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate understood and summarized the company’s mission
              effectively.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate could have also mentioned specific roles within
              the company.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate showed enthusiasm and the response was clear,
              concise and confident
            </li>
            <li>The candidate personalized the answer instead of just listing
              facts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb4o_4hCuyg"> 8. Time When You Dealt With Failure? </a></h4>
          <p>Our Analysis:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The candidate’s example was related to the position he is
              applying for (front-end).
            </li>
            <li>The candidate highlighted positive qualities: he did not give
              up, solved his problem proactively, and was not afraid to ask
              for help.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate could have quantified what success looks like.
            </li>
            <li>The candidate was able to quickly show his ability to create an
              app and deal with scale (i.e. his answer showcased his talents).
            </li>
          </ul>
