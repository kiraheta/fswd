              The practice you’ve completed in this lesson is a small taste of
              interview preparation, and we would encourage you to do more.
              Below, we have curated a list of resources that you can use for
              additional practice. Also, if you know of more resources, then
              please let us know! Not all of these resources may contain
              questions that are appropriate for the job you are seeking, so

              As you continue practicing, do your best to follow a format that
              most closely mimics an actual interview. For example, instead of
              practicing behavioral questions alone, try practicing them aloud
              with a friend. Also, try timing yourself to ensure that you are
              able to provide clear and concise answers. For technical
              questions, try coding on a whiteboard or online text editor
              instead of using an IDE and compiler.

              Now let's move forward to the interviewing dry-run!
            </p>
          <h4><a href=""> P. Interview Practice (Full Stack) </a></h4>
          <p>Employers use interviews to judge your readiness and fit for the
            job, which includes hearing about your skills and interest in the
            role. The interview is not a test or exam, but a conversation
            between you and the employer. Build your own strategies to be
            prepared come interview day. This project is one of many ways for
            you to practice!
