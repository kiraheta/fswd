          <h4> 1. Project Description </h4>
          <p>
            It's time to show off what you've learned about technical
            interviewing!
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing
            questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical
            interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient
            answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency
            of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will
            look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might
            be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one
            possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts?
            Is your code elegant and easy to read?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer the following questions:
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Question 1</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, determine
            whether some anagram of <code>t</code> is a substring of
            <code>s</code>. For example: if
            <code>s = "udacity"</code> and <code>t = "ad"</code>, then the
            function returns <code>True</code>. Your function definition
            should look like: <code>question1(s, t)</code> and return a boolean
            <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Question 2</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Given a string <code>a</code>, find the longest palindromic
            substring contained in <code>a</code>. Your function definition
            should look like <code>question2(a)</code>, and return a string.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Question 3</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Given an undirected graph G, find the minimum spanning tree within
            G. A minimum spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph with
            he smallest possible total weight of edges. Your function should
            take in and return an adjacency list structured like this:
          </p>
          <pre style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
            <code class="language-python">
<!--   -->  {'A': [('B', 2)],
<!--   -->   'B': [('A', 2), ('C', 5)],
<!--   -->   'C': [('B', 5)]}
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Vertices are represented as unique strings. The function definition
            should be <code>question3(G)</code>
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Question 4</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search
            tree. The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root
            that is an ancestor of both nodes. For example, the root is a
            common ancestor of all nodes on the tree, but if both nodes are
            descendents of the root's left child, then that left child might
            be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are
            in the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties.
            The function definition should look like
            <code>question4(T, r, n1, n2)</code>, where <code>T</code> is the
            tree represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal
            to the integer stored in that node and a <code>1</code> represents
            a child node, <code>r</code> is a non-negative integer representing
            the root, and <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are non-negative
            integers representing the two nodes in no particular order. For
            example, one test case might be
          </p>
          <pre style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
            <code class="language-python">
<!--   -->  question4([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
<!--   -->             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
<!--   -->             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
<!--   -->             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
<!--   -->             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
<!--   -->            3,
<!--   -->            1,
<!--   -->            4)
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            and the answer would be <code>3</code>.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Question 5</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Find the element in a singly linked list that's <code>m</code>
            elements from the end. For example, if a linked list has 5 elements,
            the 3rd element from the end is the 3rd element. The function
            definition should look like <code>question5(ll, m)</code>, where
            <code>ll</code> is the first node of a linked list and
            <code>m</code> is the "mth number from the end". You should
            copy/paste the <code>Node</code> class below to use as a
            representation of a node in the linked list. Return the value of
            the node at that position.
          </p>
          <pre style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;">
            <code class="language-python">
<!--   -->  class Node(object):
<!--   -->      def __init__(self, data):
<!--   -->          self.data = data
<!--   -->          self.next = None
          </code></pre>
          <h4> 2. Project: Technical Interview Practice </h4>
          <h5><strong>Project Submission</strong></h5>
          <p>
            For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing
            questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical
            interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient
            answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency
            of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will
            look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might
            be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one
            possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts?
            Is your code elegant and easy to read?
          </p>
          <h5><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></h5>
          <ol>
            <li>
              For each question, create a solution in Python (version 2). All
              solutions should be functions named as “question1”, “question2”,
              et cetera. Feel free to make additional helper functions or
              classes as needed. Code solutions must be in a file called
              "solutions.py".
            </li>
            <li>
              In the same .py file, include at least 3 test cases for each
              solution. For each test case, write the function call with the
              input you want to test and print it to the console, like "print
              question1()". On the next line, comment out the output you expect
              to see from that function call. At least 2 of these must be edge
              cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs,
              unusually large values, et cetera.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate
              text file (called "explanations.txt"). Your paragraph should not
              be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide
              your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example,
              why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain
              the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compress your one Python and one text file into a .zip, and
              submit.
            </li>
          </ol>
