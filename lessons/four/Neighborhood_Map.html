              <li>
                    <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                    You will develop a single page application featuring a map
                    of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to
                    visit. You will then add functionality to this map
                    including highlighted locations, third-party data about
                    those locations and various ways to browse the
                    content.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                    <h5>Why This Project?</h5>
                    The neighborhood map application is complex enough and
                    incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily
                    become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks,
                    libraries and APIs available to make this process more
                    manageable and many employers are looking for specific
                    skills in using these packages.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                    <h5>What Will I Learn?</h5>
                    You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a
                    manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can
                    decrease the time required developing an application and
                    provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally,
                    you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable
                    data sets that can improve the quality of your
                    application.<br><br>

                      JavaScript Design Patterns</a> and check out the
                      Neighborhood Map project
                      <a href="../../images/P_Neighborhood_Map_Rubric.pdf">

                  <li>
                      2. Download the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout
                      framework</a>. Knockout must be used to handle the list,
                      filter, and any other information on the page that is
                      subject to changing state. Things that should not be
                      handled by Knockout: anything the Maps API is used for,
                      creating markers, tracking click events on markers, making
                      the map, refreshing the map. <br><strong>Note 1:</strong>
                      Tracking click events on list items should be handled
                      with Knockout. <br><strong>Note 2:</strong> Creating your
                      markers as a part of your ViewModel is allowed (and
                      recommended). Creating them as Knockout observables is
                      not.

                  <li>
                      3. Asynchrony and Error Handling. Note that all data APIs
                      used in the project should
                      <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/handling-google-maps-in-async-and-fallback/34282">
                      load asynchronously</a> and errors should be handled
                      gracefully. In case of error (e.g. in a situation where a
                      third party API does not return the expected result) we
                      expect your webpage to do one of the following: A message
                      is displayed notifying the user that the data can't be
                      loaded, <strong>OR</strong> There are no negative
                      repercussions to the UI. <strong>Note:</strong> Please
                      note that we expect students to handle errors if the
                      browser has trouble initially reaching the 3rd-party site
                      as well. For example, imagine a user is using your
                      Neighborhood Map, but her firewall prevents her from
                      accessing the Instagram servers. Here is a reference
                      article on
                      <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-block-a-website/">
                      how to block websites</a> with the hosts file. It
                      is important to handle errors to give users a consistent
                      and good experience with the webpage. Read this
                      <a href="http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2012/12/31/asynchronous-error-handling-in-javascript/">
                      blogpost</a> to learn more. Some JavaScript libraries
                      provide special methods to handle errors. For example:
                      refer to .fail() method discussed
                      <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR">here
                      </a> if you use jQuery's ajax() method. We strongly
                      encourage you to explore ways to handle errors in the
                      library you are using to make API calls.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      4. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your
                      page using the
                      <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps
                      API</a>. For sake of efficiency, the map API should be
                      called only once.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      5. If you are prompted to do so, you may want to get a
                      <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key">
                      Google Maps API</a> key, and include it as the value of
                      the <code>key</code> parameter when loading the Google
                      Maps API in index.html:
                      <code><script
                      src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=[YOUR_API_KEY]">
                      </script></code> You may have some initial concerns with
                      placing your API key directly within your JavaScript
                      source files, but rest assured this is perfectly safe.
                      All client-side code must be downloaded by the client;
                      therefore, the client must download this API key - it is
                      not intended to be secret. Google has security measures
                      in place to ensure your key is not abused.
                      <strong>It is not technically possible to make anything
                      secret on the client-side</strong>.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      6. Write code required to display map markers identifying
                      at least 5 locations that you are interested in within
                      this neighborhood. Your app should display those
                      locations by default when the page is loaded.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      7. Implement a list view of the set of locations defined
                      in step 5.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      8. Provide a filter option that uses an input field to
                      filter both the list view and the map markers displayed
                      by default on load. The list view and the markers should
                      update accordingly in real time. Providing a search
                      function through a third-party API is not enough to meet
                      specifications. This filter can be a text input or a
                      dropdown menu.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      9. Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide
                      information when a map marker or list view entry is
                      clicked (ex: Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc).
                      Note that StreetView and Places don't count as an
                      additional 3rd party API because they are libraries
                      included in the Google Maps API. If you need a refresher
                      on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out
                      our <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud110-nd">
                      Intro to AJAX</a> course. Please provide attribution to
                      the data sources/APIs you use. For example if you are
                      using Foursquare, indicate somewhere in your interface
                      and in your README that you used Foursquare's API.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      10. Add functionality to animate a map marker when either
                      the list item associated with it or the map marker itself
                      is selected.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      11. Add functionality to open an infoWindow with the
                      information described in step 9 (you can also populate
                      a DOM element with this info, but you should still open
                      an infoWindow, even with minimal info, like location name)
                      when either a location is selected from the list view or
                      its map marker is selected directly.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      12. The app's interface should be intuitive to use. For
                      example, the input text area to filter locations should
                      be easy to locate. It should be easy to understand what
                      set of locations is being filtered. Selecting a location
                      via list item or map marker should cause the map marker
                      to bounce or in some other way animate to indicate that
                      the location has been selected and associated info window
                      should open above the map marker with additional
                      information.
                  </li><br>
                  <li>
                      Example: BART Locations San Francisco<br><br>
                      <img class="img-responsive"
                      src="../../images/bart_1.png"
                      alt="bart map"><br>
                      Clicking a marker on the map should open more information
                      about that location.<br><br>
                      <img class="img-responsive"
                      src="../../images/bart_2.png"
                      alt="bart map"><br>
                      Clicking a name in the list view should open the
                      information window for the associated marker.<br><br>
                      <img class="img-responsive"
                      src="../../images/bart_3.png"
                      alt="bart map"><br>
                      The list of locations should be filterable with a text
                      input or dropdown menu. Filtering the list also filters
                      the markers on the map.<br><br>
                      <img class="img-responsive"
                      src="../../images/bart_4.png"
                      alt="bart map"><br>
                      The web app should be mobile responsive - notice the
                      hamburger menu icon used to hide the list on small
                      screens (this is just one possible mobile
                      implementation).<br><br>

                <li>Neighborhood Map is a difficult project - that's on purpose.
                  You'll be starting with a blank slate and will be designing
                  the architecture of your app entirely on your own.</li>
                <li><strong>PLEASE</strong> don't copy work from other students.
                  We will find out and we will ask you to do the project again.
                  If you do get stuck, here are some tips for how to seek out
                  inspiration without violating the Honor Code:</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>Look at documentation and online tutorials FIRST.</li>
                  <li>If you do look at another student's work for inspiration
                      (on GitHub or elsewhere), don't copy it. Don't take any
                      part of it and don't download it. Review it to understand
                      their thought process.</li>
                  <li>Reflect on their design choices - what are some of the
                    tradeoffs of different decisions in their code?</li>
                  <li>Take a break, if need be, as you figure out how you will
                    implement your app. You have to write your own code so
                    understanding one implementation of it but taking the time
                    to think through your own implementation is extremely
                    important for your own learning and in producing original
                    work.</li>
                  <li>Return to your code and write your own implementation.
                  </li>
                  <li>Cite any submissions you looked at to give credit where
                    it is due.</li>
                </ol>
              </ol>

                <h5>Project Submission</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>You will develop a single-page application featuring a map
                      of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to
                      visit. You will then add additional functionality to this
                      application, including: map markers to identify popular
                      locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function
                      to easily discover these locations, and a listview to
                      support simple browsing of all locations. You will then
                      research and implement third-party APIs that provide
                      additional information about each of these locations
                      (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp
                      reviews, etc).</li>

              </li>

                <h5>Evaluation</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer
                      according to the Neighborhood Map Project
                      <a href="../../images/P_Neighborhood_Map_Rubric.pdf">
                      Rubric</a>. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you
                      submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order
                      to pass.</li>

                <h5>Submission</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>1. If build tools (such as Gulp or Grunt) are used,
                      submit both your source and production code in the same
                      repository in separate directories. These directories are
                      usually named <code>src</code> and <code>dist</code>
                      respectively.
                  </li>
                  <li>2. If build tools are used the gulp or grunt.js file as
                      well as the package.json file must be included in the
                      submission.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      3. If build tools are used, the instructions for building
                      the project and running the tool must be included in the
                      README.md. You may find the short

                      4. The node_modules directory may contain thousands of
                      files and should not be contained in the submission. See

                      5. The master branch is the default Github repository
                      branch. If you wish to submit another branch, you'll need
                      to set it as the
