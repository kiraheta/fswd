          <h4> 3. Personal Branding </h4>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">How to Stand Out</h5>
            <p>
              Imagine you're a hiring manager for a company, and you need to
              pick 5 people to interview for a role. But you get 50
              applications, and everyone seems pretty qualified. How do you
              compare job candidates? You'll probably pick the candidates that
              stand out the most to you.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Personal Stories</h5>
            <p>
              The thing that always makes a job candidate unique is their
              personal story - their passion and how they got there. Employers
              aren't just looking for someone with the skills, but they're
              looking for someone who can drive the company's mission and will
              be a part of innovation. That's why they need to know your work
              ethic and what drives you.
            </p>
            <p>
              As someone wanting to impress an employer, you need to tell
              your personal story. You want employers to know how you solve
              problems, overcome challenges, achieve results. You want
              employers to know what excites you, what motivates you, what
              drives you forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this can be achieved through effective storytelling, and
              effective branding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll let you know I've branded and rebranded myself many times.
              That's okay - people are complex and have multiple interests that
              change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this next video, we'll meet my coworker Chris who will show us
              how he used personal branding to help him in his recent career
              change.

                Hi, I'm Chris, a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves
                building education products. I recently developed a web app
                using AngularJS that lets teachers share student writing
                samples anonymously. I'd love to combine my passion for
                learning and teaching with my software development skills to
                continue building personalized learning products for people.
