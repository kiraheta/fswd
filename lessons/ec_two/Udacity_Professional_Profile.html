          <h4> 1. Introduction </h4>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">What are Profiles?</h5>
            <p>
              A Udacity <a href="https://profiles.udacity.com/u/edit">
                Professional Profile</a> is your direct connection to
              Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/hire-talent">hiring
                partners</a>. Using Talent Source, a directory of
              Udacity Profiles, recruiters search for candidates like yourself
              to fill a plethora of positions ranging from short-term, contract
              opportunities to full-time jobs.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">How Can I Get Into Talent Source?</h5>
            <p>
              Once you have completed two Nanodegree projects, you can enable
              your Profile's "recruiter access." Then, employers will be able
              to see your Profile if you show up in their search results. In
              this course, we'll go over how to optimize your Profile for
              search to attract the right employers. Before we get there,
              let's talk about how Talent Source works.
            </p>
          <h4> 2. Udacity Talent Source </h4>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">How Talent Source Works for Employers</h5>
            <p>
              Once signed-in to Talent Source, employers can search through
              students' and graduates' Profiles using search terms such as
              position (ie: Android Developer, Machine Learning Engineer),
              location, skills, and work type (ie: remote, part-time,
              full-time). A filtered list of candidates, as shown below, pulls
              up. A recruiter can browse through your Profile and be linked to
              your GitHub or LinkedIn profiles among others, download your
              resume or projects, and view your work history. They will be able
              to email you directly with opportunities. Check out the employer
              view of Talent Source:
            </p>
              In addition, when a hiring partner asks Udacity to recommend job
              candidates, the Udacity Careers Team will review Profiles through
              Talent Source to find matches.
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Professional Profile will be most powerful after your other
              career materials are ready, so make sure your resume, LinkedIn,
              GitHub and/or Kaggle, and other portfolio items are up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's get to creating and refining your Profile!
