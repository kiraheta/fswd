          <h4> 1. Using LinkedIn </h4>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Example</h5>
            <p>
              LinkedIn is the most popular professional networking platform out
              there, so most recruiters use it to find job seekers. It's so
              common for hiring teams to use LinkedIn to find and look at
              candidates, that it's almost a red flag if they're unable to
              find a LinkedIn profile for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s also a great platform for you to connect with other people
              in your field. Udacity for example has an Alumni LinkedIn group
              where graduates can collaborate on projects, practice job
              interviews, or discuss new trends in the industry together.
              Connecting with a fellow alum and asking for a referral would
              increase your chances of getting an interview.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Find Connections</h5>
            <p>
              The best way to use your LinkedIn effectively, however, is to
              have over 500 connections.
            </p>
            <p>
              This may seem like a lot, but once you get rolling, you'll get to
              that number fast. After you actively start using it it, by joining
              groups and going to networking events, your number of connections
              will climb. You are more likely to show up in search results on
              LinkedIn if you have more connections, which means you'll be
              more visible to recruiters.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Join Groups</h5>
            <p>
              Increasing the group of people you're connected with also exposes
              you to what they're working on or have done. For example, if you
              move to a new city, you can search your network to see who lives
              in the area, and ask for recommendations on apartment hunting,
              job leads, or other advice on adjusting to life in another city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, if you’re active in a LinkedIn group or if you frequently
              write LinkedIn blog posts, you’ll increase your visibility on the
              platform and likelihood that a recruiter will find your profile.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">How to Build Your LinkedIn Profile</h5>
            <p>
              LinkedIn guides you well when filling out your profile. It tells
              you if your profile is strong and offers recommendations on how
              to improve it. We recommend you follow LinkedIn’s advice because
              it’ll increase your visibility on the network, thus increasing
              the number of opportunities you may come across.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Tips for an Awesome LinkedIn Profile</h5>
            <p>
              In the lessons on conducting a successful job search and resume
              writing, we talk about how you can describe your work experiences
              in a way that targets a specific job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use what you learn to describe your experiences in LinkedIn's
              projects and work sections. You can even copy and paste over the
              bullet points in your resume to the work or project sections of
              LinkedIn. Making sure your resume and LinkedIn are consistent
              helps build your personal brand.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Find Other Networking Platforms</h5>
            <p>
              Remember that LinkedIn isn’t the only professional networking
              platform out there. If you do have a great LinkedIn profile, that
              means you can also build an amazing profile on other platforms.
              Find some recommendations for online profiles on the Career
              Resource Center.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Up Next</h5>
            <p>
              By now, you know how to target your job profile to your dream job.
              You know how to market yourself effectively through building off
              your elevator pitch. Being confident in this will help you
              network naturally, whether on LinkedIn or at an event in-person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Move on to the LinkedIn Profile Review and get personalized
              feedback on your online presence.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Career Counselors</h5>
            <p>
              Remember that career counselors are always available to help you
              on your job search. Make an appointment with them
              <a href="https://calendly.com/career-coach">here</a>.

          <h4><a href=""> 2. LinkedIn Profile Review </a></h4>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Project Submission</h5>
            <p>
              LinkedIn has become the giant in professional networking, to the
              point where it may be a red flag if you don't have a LinkedIn
              profile. Use your LinkedIn to find connections and join groups,
              which are great ways to find opportunities. Most importantly, have
              opportunities come to you by optimizing your LinkedIn profile for
              recruiter searches!
            </p>
            <h5 style="color:tomato;">Submission Instructions</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>1. Follow LinkedIn's specific guidelines on completing your
                profile. This will help you use it effectively (ie: turn up in
                boolean search results, get relevant suggestions for jobs).
              </li>
              <li>2. Apply Udacity's LinkedIn guidelines, found under Project
                Resources below. These specifications were created with
                recruiter and LinkedIn experts' input.
              </li>
              <li>3. Make sure your LinkedIn profile is public by
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=nprofile-public-profile-settings-redirect">checking
                your settings</a>.
              </li>
              <li>4. Create a custom public profile URL
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=nprofile-public-profile-settings-redirect">on the same public
                profile edit page</a>.
              </li>
              <li>5. Submit that URL as your project.
              </li>

              Although LinkedIn is the primary networking profile you'll use,
              there are plenty more out there, such as on GitHub, Kaggle (for
              data science), AngelList, etc. Use what you've learned in this
              project and apply it throughout your online profiles!
