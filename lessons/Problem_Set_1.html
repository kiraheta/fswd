              Problem Sets are completely optional but are designed to guide you
              into solving development challenges on your own while still being
              able to rely on your peers and instructors as auxiliary resources.
              Upon completing the problem sets, you will not only have
              additional projects to add to your portfolio, but be prepared to
              exceed specifications on your Nanodegree projects.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              <strong>Resources</strong><br>
              In order to complete the exercises in this problem set, you will
              need to rely on the SQLAlchemy documentation and Python
              documentation heavily. You are free to use any other outside
              resources like StackOverflow or Flask blogs but we would like you
              to get into the habit of going to the original documentation
              before looking for tutorials.<br><br>

              <li>For this exercise you will be the database architect for the
                Uda County District of Animal Shelters. The shelters need a
                database for adopting puppies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4> 3. Exercise 1 - Setting up the DB </h4>
            <ol style="list-style-type:square">
              <li>
                I have drawn up the following layout for my database. Go ahead
                and create a python file to model this database layout or
                create one of your own. In the next exercise I will provide
                you some code to help populate this database. This code should
                create a SQLite file called puppies.db in your working
                directory. Refer to the database_setup.py file you created for
                reference.<br><br>

                Youâ€™ve already seen the Integer and String column properties
                used in the restaurant menu database, check out the SQLAlchemy
                documentation to view some of the other properties you can use
                to define your column

            <ol style="list-style-type:square">
              <li>
                Using SQLAlchemy perform the following queries on your database:<br><br>
                1. Query all of the puppies and return the results in ascending alphabetical order<br>
                2. Query all of the puppies that are less than 6 months old organized by the youngest first<br>
                3. Query all puppies by ascending weight<br>
                4. Query all puppies grouped by the shelter in which they are staying<br><br>
